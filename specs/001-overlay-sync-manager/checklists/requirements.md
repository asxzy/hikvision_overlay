# Specification Quality Checklist: Overlay Sync Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Resolved Clarifications

1. **User Story 3, Acceptance Scenario 4**: Configuration reload mechanism
   - **Decision**: Require restart (no hot-reload)
   - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation aligned with minimal code principle. Suitable for infrequent configuration updates.

2. **FR-003**: Configuration file format
   - **Decision**: JSON format
   - **Rationale**: Native Python standard library support (no external dependencies), easier programmatic generation, aligns with minimal code principle.

### Validation Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass:
- ✅ Content quality verified
- ✅ Requirements complete and testable
- ✅ Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ No clarifications remaining
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`).
